Flickr Fetch
Small application to demo fetching a collection of photos from flickr along with title based local filtering

Areas for improvement
*FLUX, move API request to an action, create a PhotoStore to hold original and filtered version of payload
*Pagination, create grid to allow user to change the paging values, add page details to restwrapper template, and recall action with each pagination click
*Unit Tests, plenty of good testing opportunities in the filtering and image url generation
*Have flickrImage component render links for alternate sizes
